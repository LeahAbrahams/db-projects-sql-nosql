## Project 2: Class Management (NoSQL)
A data modeling project implemented using **MongoDB**, focusing on managing a set of classes and students.

### Key Features
* **Document Modeling:** Designing collections for classes and staff using a NoSQL approach.
* **Data Operations:** Implementing data insertion and advanced search/filter queries.
* **Aggregate:** Basic use of MongoDB's filtering and grouping capabilities.

### Tech Stack
* **Database:** MongoDB
